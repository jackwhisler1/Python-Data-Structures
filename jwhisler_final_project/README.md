Overview
The Budget and Expense Tracker is a Python application designed to help users manage personal finances through a simple command-line interface. It allows users to record expenses with a date, category, description, and amount, then save or reload that data from a file. The program summarizes total spending by category, highlights the largest expense, and generates a formatted report for later review.

This project demonstrates practical use of Python programming concepts, file handling, object-oriented design, and data structures. It provides a complete workflow for entering, storing, and analyzing expense data while maintaining a user-friendly interaction model.
